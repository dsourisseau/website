### RESEARCH INTERESTS

My passion for volcanoes began when I discovered the history of Pompei and the 79AD eruption from Mt. Vesuvius when I was 12 years old. After that, I obtained a Licence in Earth Sciences, a Master degree, and a Ph.D. in Earth Sciences with volcanology specialty where I learned the fundamentals of volcanology, geochemistry, petrology, and geochronology. I also learned the Matlab, Python, and Latex programming languages as complementary tools.

Plinian and ultra-Plinian eruptions emit huge volumes of magmas that result in the generation of extensive pyroclastic fall and pyroclastic density currents that can have devastating consequences at local, regional, and global scales. Because of their large magnitude, these eruptions can discharge ash into the global atmospheric circulation system and blanket the landscape with tephra for up to thousands of kilometers around the source volcano.
<br /><br />

Because these tephra deposits represent a non-negligible part of the pyroclastic deposit emitted through explosive eruptions, their descriptions and quantifications are essential to obtain representative estimations of the eruption volumes. In addition, these tephra layers are also widely used to establish the chronology of archeological, paleomagnetic, and climatic change records given their presence in terrestrial, lacustrine, marine, and glacial depositional settings.

###### understand the processes that produce volcanic eruptions, and describe their products.

###### To mitigate the consequences of future eruptions on our society, the deposits from past explosive eruptions need to be described to understand the behavious of volcanoes, and know what kind of event could occurs in the future.

###### I could use my knowledge of tephra deposits to understand how fluctuated the climate in the past, and understand the changes that will occur in the future due to the global warming.
