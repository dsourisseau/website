Plinian and ultra-plinian eruptions emit huge volumes of magmas that results in the generation of extensive pyroclastic fall and pyroclastic density currents that can have devastating consequences at local, regional and global scales. Because of their large magnitude, these eruptions can discharge ash into the global atmospheric circulation system and blanket the landscape with tephra for up to thousands of kilometers around the source volcano.
<br />

Because tephra layers occurs in terrestrial, lacustrine, marine, and glacial depositional settings, these deposits are widely used to establish the chronology of archeological, paleomagnetic, and climatic change records. The description and quantification of those deposits are also essential to obtain representative estimation of the eruption volume.

###### understand the processes that produce volcanic eruptions, and describe their products.

###### To mitigate the consequences of future eruptions on our society, the deposits from past explosive eruptions need to be described to understand the behavious of volcanoes, and know what kind of event could occurs in the future.

###### I could use my knowledge of tephra deposits to understand how fluctuated the climate in the past, and understand the changes that will occur in the future due to the global warming.
