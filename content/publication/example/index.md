abstract: La Primavera caldera is a Quaternary rhyolitic volcanic field located
  in the western part of the Trans-Mexican-Volcanic-Belt (TMVB). The caldera
  forming eruption of La Primavera occurred ~95 ka with the emplacement of the
  Tala ignimbrite. Here, we present a new stratigraphy and evolution of the
  post-caldera activity based on intense fieldwork, correlation of deposits, and
  ten 230Th/U geochronology dates in zircons. The collapse produced an 11-km
  wide caldera followed by the formation of an intra-caldera lake. After the
  caldera collapse, several rhyolitic domes were extruded, inside and outside
  the caldera ring-fault until 26.8 ka. The first post-caldera pyroclastic event
  took place 86.4 ka with the eruption that emplaced the Giant Pumice (GP)
  followed by the occurrence of at least fourteen pyroclastic units (UA to UN).
  The intra-caldera explosive activity came from the central resurgent Nejahuete
  composite dome with the deposition of the GP and A to D units between 86.4 and
  71.5 ka. The extra-caldera explosive activity came from the San Miguel,
  Planillas and Tajo volcanic centers with the deposition of the E to N units
  inside the caldera and south of the caldera ring fault between 71.5 and 26.8
  ka. Three eruptions were originated at San Miguel volcanic center between 71.5
  and 60.3 ka (units E, G and H) and six eruptions dated between 68.9 and 44.7
  ka were originated at Planillas volcanic center (units F, I, J, K, L and M).
  The last eruption of the caldera occurred between 44.7 and 26.8 ka at the Tajo
  volcanic center (UN). The eruptions appear as pyroclastic successions
  interbedded with lake deposits (units GP and A-B) and as subaerial deposits
  separated by paleosols or lahar deposits (units C-M). The revised stratigraphy
  indicates that the caldera resurgence occurred right after the caldera
  collapse 93.8 ka and continued until 75.8 ka. This new pyroclastic
  stratigraphy provides key information on the post-caldera evolution of La
  Primavera.
