Pico de Orizaba, also known as Citlaltépetl, is an andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano located on the boundary between Veracruz and Puebla in the eastern part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

Pico de Orizaba is the highest volcano in Mexico and the third-highest peak in North America, rising to 5,636 meters above sea level.

The geological evolution of Pico de Orizaba has been divided into three main stages:

* Phase 1: Construction and subsequent collapse of the Torrecillas volcano (650–210 ka),

* Phase 2: Construction of the Espolón de Oro volcano on the remnants of the Torrecillas edifice, and subsequent collapse of the edifice (210–16.5 ka) (Carrasco-Núñez et al., 1993),

* Phase 3: Development of the **present-day Citlaltépetl volcano** on the remnants of the Espolón de Oro volcano (13 ka to present).

The eruptive history of Citlaltépetl was marked by repeated dome growth and collapse, Vulcanian and Plinian explosive activity, and effusive eruptions that produced a sequence of dacitic lava flows interlayered with andesitic to dacitic pyroclastic flow and fallout deposits.

Although currently quiescent, Pico de Orizaba is considered an active volcano with potential for future activity. 

The symmetrical cone, extensive glacial features, and well-preserved summit crater make Pico de Orizaba one of the most iconic volcano of Mexico.

## **Xilomich eruptive episode (8-9 ka)**

Pico de Orizaba experienced a phase of intense explosive activity between 8 and 9 ka in the early Holocene (Xilomich eruptive episode). A series of ten scoria-and-ash and block-and-ash pyroclastic flow deposits were generated by vulcanian explosions and dome-collapse events during this period (Sourisseau et al., 2025).
