## Pico de Orizaba
* Pico de Orizaba, also known as Citlaltépetl, is an andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano located on the boundary between Veracruz and Puebla in the eastern part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

* Pico de Orizaba is the highest volcano in Mexico and the third-highest peak in North America, rising to 5,636 meters above sea level.

* The geological evolution of Pico de Orizaba has been divided into three main stages: (1) construction and subsequent collapse of the Torrecillas volcano (650–210 ka); (2) construction of the Espolón de Oro volcano on the remnants of the Torrecillas edifice, and subsequent collapse of the edifice (210–16.5 ka) (Carrasco-Núñez et al., 1993); and (3) development of the present-day Citlaltépetl volcano on the remnants of the Espolón de Oro volcano (13 ka to present).

* The eruptive history of Citlaltépetl (13 ka to present) was marked by repeated dome growth and collapse, Vulcanian and Plinian explosive activity, and effusive eruptions that produced a sequence of dacitic lava flows interlayered with andesitic to dacitic pyroclastic flow and fallout deposits.

* Although currently quiescent, Pico de Orizaba is considered an active volcano with potential for future activity. 

* The symmetrical cone, extensive glacial features, and well-preserved summit crater make Pico de Orizaba one of the most iconic volcano of Mexico.

## **Xilomich eruptive episode 8-9 ka**

* Between 8 and 9 ka in the early Holocene (Xilomich eruptive episode), Pico de Orizaba experienced a phase of intense explosive activity. A series of ten pyroclastic flow deposits, including scoria-and-ash and block-and-ash layers, were generated by vulcanian explosions and dome-collapse events during this period (Sourisseau et al., 2025).
