## La Primavera caldera
* La Primavera (LP) is a rhyolitic Quaternary volcanic complex located in the western part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, on the western outskirts of Guadalajara, the third most populated city of Mexico (5.2 million people, INEGI 2020).

* LP is composed of a 11 km-diameter caldera formed during the ~95 ka Tala Ignimbrite eruption, lavas, domes, and stratovolcanoes that were emplaced inside, on the caldera rim, and outside the caldera ring fault between 93 and 25 ka.

* La Primavera is still active as evidenced by geothermal fumaroles and hot springs, inside the caldera close to the Cuate/Chato domes, south of Nejahuete, and south of the San Miguel and Planillas volcanoes south of the caldera rim.

## **Post-caldera pyroclastic stratigraphy**
* Fifteen explosve eruptions occured after the formation of the LP caldera. The Giant Pumice Horizon (Unit GPH - 86.4 ka) and the A-D pyroclastic units were originated from the Nejahuete volcano (86.4 to 71.5 ka) located in the center of the caldera on the Cerrito Colorado circular partial-ring-fault. Then the E to M pyroclastic units were originated from the San miguel and Planillas volcanoes, located on a fault south of the caldera (71.5-68.9 to 44.7 ka). Finally, the N unit came from the Tajo volcano (44.7-26.8 ka) (Sourisseau et al., 2020).

## **Caldera evolution**
Domes, volcanoes, and lavas were emplaced inside, on the caldera rim, and outside the caldera after the La Primavera caldera formation (Sourisseau et al., 2020; Macías et al., submitted):

<u>Between 95 and 86.4 ka:</u> The base of the Nejahuete volcano was formed on the Cerrito Colorado partial ring-fault, while several domes were emplaced on the caldera ring-fault (Piñar de la Venta, Cuartilla, Chapulin, and Tule). The Animas, Puerta, and the base of the San Miguel volcano were also emplaced during this phase.

<u>Between 86.4 and 69 ka:</u> The Cerro Alto dome was emplaced on the Cerrito Colorado partial ring-fault. Several domes were also emplaced on the caldera ring-fault (Lobera, Ixtahuatonte, Cuesta, Culebreado, and Pedernal). Formation of the northern and southern lavas of San Miguel.

<u>Between 62 and 44.7 ka:</u> Formation of the Llano Grande lava and Planillas volcano south of the caldera.

<u>Between 32 and 25 ka:</u> Formation of the Tajo volcano and Colli dome.

## **6.4 ka Colli dome eruption**
* The last eruption occured some 6.4 ka at Colli dome northeast of the caldera ring-fault. This eruption formed a sequence of dilute and dense pyroclastic flows with abundant accretionary lapilli, and minor pyroclastic fall deposits (Sourisseau et al., in press).
